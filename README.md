## Introduction

**nf-cmgg/wisecondorx** is a bioinformatics pipeline that creates a reference for WisecondorX

1. Convert the alignment files to NPZ format (`WisecondorX convert`)
2. Create a reference from all NPZ files (`WisecondorX newref`)

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-cmgg/wisecondorx \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

See the [parameters](docs/parameters.md) documentation for more information on all the options.

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
