## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- SampleGender (ngs-bits) - Determine the gender from a BAM/CRAM file
- WiseCondorX convert - Convert CRAM/BAM files to NPZ files
- WiseCondorX newref- Create a new reference from all NPZ files
- MultiQC- Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- Pipeline information - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution
